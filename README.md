# Sumo-Robot
Our sumo battle robot features a continuously scanning ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo that detects opponents from multiple angles. This innovative design helped us advance to round 3 in the competition by providing superior opponent detection while our infrared sensors kept us safely within the ring's boundaries.
